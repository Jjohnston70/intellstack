## Tips and Best Practices

### Before Starting a New Client

1. **Review the Map stage notes** from Direction Protocol
2. **Confirm module selection** matches client needs
3. **Verify payment** received before starting work
4. **Block calendar time** for each phase

### During Development

1. **Use the module installer** - don't rebuild from scratch
2. **Test incrementally** - don't wait until the end
3. **Document as you go** - easier than documenting later
4. **Save all credentials** in 1Password immediately

### During Training

1. **Record the session** for client reference
2. **Start with the dashboard** they'll use daily
3. **Demonstrate the most important action first**
4. **Leave time for questions**

### Post-Launch

1. **Monitor Day 1 closely** - catch issues early
2. **Proactive communication** beats reactive
3. **Compile stats** for the 2-week check-in
4. **Request testimonial** while satisfaction is high
