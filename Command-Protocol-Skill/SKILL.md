description: TNDS Command Protocol - Complete client delivery process from contract signing through go-live and ongoing support. Use when implementing Command modules, running through delivery phases, creating client documentation, setting up Google Apps Script projects, configuring automations, conducting training, or managing post-launch support. Triggers on phrases like "client delivery", "implement for client", "install module", "set up command center", "build for client", "training session", "go-live", "post-launch", "Command Protocol", "technical setup", or when transitioning from Direction Protocol to delivery. Integrates with the module installer at the 10_COMMANDS path for standardized deployments.

# TNDS Command Protocol™ Skill

A structured, twelve-phase delivery process for implementing Command modules and putting clients in command of their operations.

## Core Principle

We don't just build systems. We put clients in command of their operations.

**The Transformation:** Direction Protocol gets you clarity. Command Protocol gets you control. That's how we turn data into direction.

## Module Installer Location

```
C:\Users\truenorth\Desktop\TNDS-Command-Center\10_COMMANDS\client-google-apps-module-setup
```

This installer contains templates and setup scripts for all Command modules. Reference it during Phase 4 (Development) for standardized deployments.
