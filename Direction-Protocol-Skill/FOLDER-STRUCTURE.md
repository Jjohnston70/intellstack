## Active Client Folder Structure (30_ACTIVE_CLIENTS)

```
30_ACTIVE_CLIENTS/[Company-Name]/
├── 00-Direction-Protocol/      ← All sales materials
│   ├── IDENTIFY-notes.md
│   ├── ASSESS-notes.md
│   ├── MAP-findings.md
│   ├── complexity-scoring.md
│   ├── proposal.md
│   └── service-agreement.pdf
└── 01-Implementation/          ← Command Protocol files
    ├── context-graph.md        ← v2.0 (upgraded from v1.0)
    ├── kickoff-notes.md
    └── (additional implementation files)
```

---

## Nurture Folder Structure (25_NURTURE)

For "Not Now" prospects:

```
25_NURTURE/[Company-Name]-Pending/
├── IDENTIFY-notes.md
├── ASSESS-notes.md
├── MAP-findings.md
├── complexity-scoring.md
├── context-graph.md
├── proposal.md
└── nurture-notes.md           ← Follow-up tracking
```

---

## Archive Folder Structure (90_ARCHIVE)

For walk-aways and unresponsive:

```
90_ARCHIVE/
└── [Year]/
    ├── [Company-Name]-WalkAway/
    │   └── (all files from prospect folder)
    └── [Company-Name]-NoResponse/
        └── (all files from prospect folder)
```

---

## ARO Assessment Integration

If prospect completed ARO Assessment before Direction Protocol:

```
30_ACTIVE_CLIENTS/[Company-Name]/
├── 00-ARO-Assessment/          ← ARO deliverables
│   ├── intake-questionnaire-responses.md
│   ├── discovery-notes.md
