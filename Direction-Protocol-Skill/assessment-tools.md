## Email Templates

### After IDENTIFY - Schedule Assess

```
Subject: Next Step: Understanding [Company] Operations

Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking the time to talk today. Based on what you shared about [primary pain point], I think there might be a good fit here.

The next step is what we call the Assess stage - a 30-minute conversation where I dig deeper into how your operation actually runs. This helps me figure out if I can actually help and what it might look like.

Would [Day] at [Time] work for you?

Talk soon,
Jacob Johnston
True North Data Strategies
719-204-6365
```

### After IDENTIFY - Not a Fit

```
Subject: Re: [Company] Operations

Hi [Name],

I appreciate you taking the time to talk today. Based on what you're looking for, I don't think I'm the right fit right now. [Brief honest reason - size, need, budget, etc.]

If things change or you grow into a different situation, feel free to reach back out.

Best of luck,
Jacob Johnston
```

### After ASSESS - Schedule Map

```
Subject: Deep Dive: Mapping [Company] Operations

Hi [Name],

Our conversation yesterday confirmed what I suspected - there's definitely something here we can help with.

The next step is the Map stage - a 90-minute deep dive where we'll walk through your entire operation to understand exactly what's broken and what would fix it. This is required before I quote anything because every operation is different.

Can you block off 90 minutes [Day] at [Time]?

Before we meet, it would help to have:
- [Specific prep item 1]
- [Specific prep item 2]
- [Specific prep item 3]

Looking forward to it,
Jacob Johnston
```

### After MAP - Schedule Chart

```
Subject: Chart Presentation: Your Operational Roadmap

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the deep dive yesterday. I've got a clear picture now of what's happening and what would fix it.

I've put together what we call the Chart - a presentation that shows:
- What we discovered about your operation
- The specific problems and root causes
- The solution we'd build
- Timeline and investment

Can we schedule 30-45 minutes [Day] at [Time] to walk through it?

Talk soon,
Jacob Johnston
```

### After CHART - Closing

```
Subject: [Company] Command Center Build - Ready to Launch

Hi [Name],

Great conversation yesterday. Based on your go-ahead, I'm sending over:

1. Service Agreement - please review and sign
2. First invoice (50%) - $[amount] due to start
3. Kickoff meeting invite - [Date/Time]

Once I receive the signed agreement and first payment, we'll officially kick off and have your Command Center built in [X] weeks.

Questions? Just reply or call.

Let's do this,
Jacob Johnston

## Red Flag Checklist

Use this during any stage to identify deal-breakers:

```
☐ Won't commit time for Map stage
☐ Wants price before assessment
☐ Wants guaranteed outcomes you can't control
☐ Argues about price before understanding scope
☐ Expects you to manage their team
☐ "Tried everything" mentality
☐ Blames everyone else
☐ Disrespectful of your time
☐ Vibe is off / dread working with them
☐ Keeps rescheduling/no-showing
☐ Won't answer direct questions
☐ Unwilling to change anything
☐ Looking for silver bullet solution
☐ Not decision maker (and won't loop them in)
☐ Budget misalignment (can't afford minimum)
```

**2+ red flags = seriously consider walking away**
**4+ red flags = walk away immediately**

---

## Green Flag Checklist

Look for these positive indicators:

```
☐ Shows up on time, prepared
☐ Asks good questions
☐ Takes notes during conversations
☐ Shares detailed operational info freely
☐ Acknowledges their role in problems
☐ Open to changing how they do things
☐ Sees value beyond price
☐ Decision maker is engaged
☐ Team is bought in
☐ Has tried to solve this before
☐ Respects the process
☐ Follows through on commitments
☐ Good referral source
☐ Industry experience/expertise
☐ Growth trajectory
```

**6+ green flags = high probability close**
