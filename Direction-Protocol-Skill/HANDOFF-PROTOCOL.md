## PART 4: Post-Handoff Actions

### Immediate (Same Day)

**Email:**

- [ ] Attach timeline and scope documents
- [ ] Confirm next check-in date

**CRM:**
- [ ] Update deal to "Implementation - In Progress"

- [ ] Set milestone tasks and dates

**Files:**
- [ ] Update Context Graph to v2.0 (Implementation Baseline)
- [ ] Add kickoff notes to 01-Implementation folder
- [ ] Organize any new materials received

### Context Graph v1.0 → v2.0 Update

After kickoff, update the Context Graph:

- [ ] Version: 1.0 → 2.0
- [ ] Status: "Assessment" → "Implementation - Week 1"
- [ ] Add implementation contract details
- [ ] Add timeline and milestones
- [ ] Add access credentials/notes (secure storage)

- [ ] Flag any blockers immediately
- [ ] Document any scope clarifications needed

### Ongoing Communication

**Check-in cadence:** Weekly or bi-weekly depending on project length

**Each check-in should cover:**
1. What was completed since last check-in
2. What's planned for next period
3. Any blockers or questions
4. Client feedback on deliverables

**Update Context Graph:** After each significant interaction or decision

## PART 5: Handoff from ARO Assessment

If the client completed an ARO Assessment before Direction Protocol, additional considerations apply.

### What ARO Assessment Provides

- Context Architecture Report (operational scoring)
- Implementation Roadmap (prioritized improvements)
- Context Graph v1.0 (already populated)
- Documentation System Recommendation

### Integration Steps

1. **Review ARO Deliverables:** Understand what was found
2. **Validate Findings:** Confirm nothing has changed
3. **Apply $500 Credit:** Ensure pricing reflects the credit
4. **Use Existing Context Graph:** Build on v1.0, don't recreate

### ARO → Direction → Command Protocol Flow

```
ARO Assessment (ASSESS + MAP equivalent)
        ↓
    $500 credit applied
        ↓
Direction Protocol (abbreviated - skip to CHART)
        ↓
    Agreement signed
        ↓
Command Protocol (Implementation)
```

### File Management

```

## Handoff Quality Standards

### What "Good" Looks Like

A successful handoff means:
1. **No information loss:** Everything from Direction Protocol is captured and accessible
2. **Clear scope:** Both sides agree on what's included and what's not
3. **Realistic timeline:** Dates are achievable, not aspirational
4. **Access secured:** All necessary access granted before work begins
5. **Communication established:** Clear channels and expectations set
6. **Documented context:** Anyone could pick up this project from the Context Graph

### Red Flags During Handoff

Watch for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | What to Do |
|----------|------------|
| Client seems confused about scope | Stop and clarify; don't proceed with misalignment |
| Can't get access to systems | Set hard deadline; don't start work without access |
| Decision-maker not on kickoff | Reschedule to include them |
| Significant changes since MAP | May need to revisit pricing/scope |
| Client already making requests outside scope | Address immediately; document scope boundaries |

### Post-Handoff Success Metrics

Track these to measure handoff quality:
- Time from signed agreement to kickoff: Target <7 days
- Access obtained before work begins: 100%
- Scope changes requested within Week 1: <10%
- Client satisfaction at first check-in: >4/5

**Document Status:** Complete
**Next Review:** After first 5 handoffs
**Feedback:** Note what works, what breaks, what's missing
